# VBC_HW_01
First homework assignment for Vandy Coding Boot Camp

I made sure that the navigation links at the top were active

I made notes in the body

I renamed some divs

I condensed some of the CSS coding to try and clean it up

I tried to solve the text resizing issues for when you change the screen size,
but realized I'm not that far along yet

I cried a little

but then I loaded it up to Github and created a link, and then I felt better
